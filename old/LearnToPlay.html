Mechs and Marines is a tabletop war game where 2 or more opponents control a battle force to complete objectives. <br>
The gameplay is split into two key actions, MOVEMENT and COMBAT. <br> 
Once the players have decided the order in which they will take their turns, they then enter the MOVEMENT phase, where the player can move their units according to their characteristics on their data sheets. And the role of the die that accompanies their movements. <br>
Once the movement phase has been completed by a player, they then enter the COMBAT phase, where they must select which of their units is attacking which of their opponents’ units. For a unit to enter combat with an opposing unit, they must be within 2 parameters… <br> <br>

Range and Line of sight. <br>
For a unit to be within range, the player must count the number of squares between their attacking unit and the unit for which they are attacking. They must then check if the attacking units weapon range can reach across the distance proposed. <br>
For example: If a rifleman has a range of 6 and his target is within 6 squares of him directly. Then combat can begin. <br>
However, line of sight must be obtained along with being within range for damage to be dealt. <br>
Line of sight works as it sounds. If an attacking unit has a clear shot with no obstructions and is within range of their target, then the players can begin rolling dice to determine the outcome of the battle. <br>
If an enemy is not fully within line of sight, this is known as COVER or PARTIAL LINE OF SIGHT, this then grants the unit who is being attacked a +1 to their EVADE ROLL. <br> <br>

Once combat has been established, the players can then begin to roll the dice to determine the outcomes of their fights. <br>
Once the attacking player has made it known, which of their units is attacking which enemy unit, the enemy must first complete an EVADE ROLL. <br>
The success of the EVADE ROLL depends on that enemy unit’s evade stat on their data sheet. If they pass their EVADE ROLL then the enemy completely negates all damage and the attacking units’ actions have been spent. <br>
However, if the enemy fails their EVADE ROLL, then the attacker has the enemy in their sights. <br>
The attacker must then complete an ACCURACY ROLL to determine if their shots actually land on target or not. This is determined by the accuracy stat on the attacker’s data sheet. <br>
If the ACCURACY ROLL goes through then the attacker moves on to their DAMAGE ROLL, if the ACCURACY ROLL does not go through then the enemy negates all damage once more. <br>
The DAMAGE ROLL is pretty self-explanatory, the number rolled on the dice is the number of damage that the enemy unit takes. <br>
Each player must remember the number of health points that each of their units have remaining, this can be done either by note taking or more conveniently by the use of damage dials.  <br>
Once these actions have been completed for each of a player’s units, then their turn is over, and it is on to the next player for their turn. <br>
Happy Hunting.
