 In the distant future, humanity has entered it’s second era of exploration and colonisation, leaving earth behind for the ones wealthy and fortunate enough to call it home. Human expansion has become a vast enterprise, leaving our solar system behind, our species has spread across the stars, with each member of the human race seeing it as an opportunity for one reason or another.
  <br><br>
Unfortunately, business is the way of the universe, with profit often being put above human life, after all, workers can be “obtained” in various ways, but resources must be acquired. As a result of this corporate greed, many within the colonies find themselves resisting the hostile nature of these corporations and choose to strike back against the onslaught of profit over people, fighting for their home planets and their resources.
</p>
<p>
<h2 id = "prov">Providers</h2>
These resistant military forces, come in all shapes and sizes, making the most of what hey have at their disposal, from the agricultural planets making the most of their harvesting mechs and equipping them with any military armaments that they can find. 
  <br><br>
They are led by the daughter of the first resistance leader, Ruth Larceny, from the planet Bauer, this goldilocks planet is perfect for human habitation but more importantly to the corporations, perfect for growing the crops needed to feed humanity. There are several sister planets in the same goldilocks zone as Bauer, giving them the nickname the ‘provider belt’. The provider belts armies consist of the settlers of the planets, fed up with their lives being seen as collateral and industrial wastage. The providers are the most established resistance army and are seen as the poster boys for the other systems to rally behind, whilst simultaneously being seen as the main threat to the corporations, who value money over morals. 
  <br><br>
The providers are rugged but effective fighters, they favour intelligent combat infantry and strategies over sheer firepower and mechanical reinforcements, they are a well balanced and well organised fighting force. Their primary fighting colours consist of burnt orange, and olive green representing the sun rising over their nurturing crops found on their home world. Their pilots are also noted for favouring ‘booster packs’ which attach to the base of their spines allowing them enhanced mobility on the battlefields.
</p>
<p>
<h2 id = "surf">Surface Men</h2>
On the other end of resistance spectrum, would be the surface men, a coalition formed between the mining colonies, who are actively revolting against the larger corporation for which they are forced into servitude. Over anything, they want nothing more than the complete annihilation of the corporations who actively disregard them as even human, simply just organic labour. They are willing to sacrifice their own men women and children if it resulted in the demise of one private corporation outpost, their entire fighting force is derived from anger, allowing them to go to extreme lengths to achieve their goals. The surface men’s aesthetic is heavily industrial, with soot and grime being the only adjacent colours too their burgundy red industrial equipment. Their pilots choose the exo skeletal booster kit as it provides additional strength and protection over the barebones jump pack seen by the providers. 
  <br><br>
Their leader Riddeon Stone famously united the fragmented mining factions when he trapped corporate investors on a visit to their mine, within the underground chambers and flooded it with the volatile gas as he watched the life leave their corpses, a man truly tired of the way the universe was run.
  <br><br>
The military tactics seen within this there ranks favour mechanical droids over any others due to them being a particularly brutal fighting force, after all, it is easier to remove the worst of humanity when the units doing it aren’t even human. The surface men originally have no single home world, with the corporations choosing to simply ship them off to where the most resources are located. However, their initial revolt took place in the mines beneath the surface of quoro, a baron lifeless planet, with thick industrial gasses further polluting the toxic atmosphere being pumped up from the underground pockets of gas found whilst mining, of this resource rich exo planet. 
</p>
<p>
<h2 id = "refi">Refineers</h2>
Bridging the gap between the Milita resistances and the corporations but ultimately siding with the corporations. The Refineers, find themselves seeing the pain and suffering caused by the corporations but are paid very handsomely for the services they provide to the rich and powerful ultimately turning their heads to the help of the outer colonies. They are often seen as the life blood of human intergalactic expansion, with them providing atomised petroleum, the vital fuel needed in powering the majority of modern equipment, from the ships needed to transport units to the battlefield, all the way to the mechs themselves. They are easily distinguishable from the other factions in the universe by their distinct, yellow hazard, markings on their otherwise grey outfits and equipment, not too dissimilar from modern construction equipment. 
  <br><br>
Similarly to the likes of the Providers their choice in combat unit varies from mission to mission with them using what they deem as the most efficient, from the dumb might of droids to capture objectives, to the free moving abilities of human units, however, unlike the providers, and the surface men, the refineers are highly skilled in fortifications and defence strategies, after all the corporations do pay them handsomely to protect their precious and valuable fuel depots. 
  <br><br>
Their poster boy and head of security based on their key refuelling belt known as Falro 2, Argeen Klaus, is the conflicted leader of the refineers, after being raised on the provider belt, he saw the destructive and domineering nature of the corporations on the lives of the settlers, however instead of choosing to fight them, he ultimately chose to join them, however his loyalties are often questioned by the higher ups of the corporations. Refineers pilots are noted for using grav gloves to aid their enhanced movements, allowing them to climb with ease, cling to walls and grip like a constrictor.
</p>
<p>
<h2 id = "corp">Corporations</h2>
Finally, there are the corporations, split into various benefactors and investment factions, their one goal is to monopolise the known galaxy. To suck every last credit out of the colonies. Earth being their home world, an impenetrable fortress of a planet, protected by the solar gateway where each planet orbiting the sun acts as a secure check point before access. Earth in this period has been transformed into a utopia like marble in space, where no government rules the countries or continents, only the companies. Each of the continents allocated a managing director with the each of their said capital cities, appearing more like a futuristic Rome or Athens, with grand marble pillars, pools and lush greenery being woven into the very foundations of society. It is by all intents and purposes a lush Utopia. This however is all funded and provided by the exploitation of the outer colonies and their workers, with many of the residents of Earth and her Solar neighbours being fully aware of what is occurring in the galaxy but choosing not to accept it as fact. 
  <br><br>
At the helm of the cradle of humanity is the CEO a figure who is never seen or even heard but is always able to make his presence known, probably due to extreme paranoia and fear of attempts on his life. The only interaction the CEO has, is with his head of security, Monocle, a former military tactician, who was shot in the face on the battlefield, with his abilities and know how too valuable to the corporations, the executive decision was made to preserve his mind and knowledge whilst retaining what was left of him, the result was his toned and defined human physique, with a robotic head with one singular lens, in similar shape to that of a security camera, and thus the mysterious battle tactician known as monocle was born. 
  <br><br>
With monocle at the helm of the corporations Milita, he made cold calculated decisions, choosing to favour cunning overall, whilst favouring stealth tactics when possible but ultimately still not afraid to use all out-war strategies inflicting maximum damage to any who stood against the corporate might. His aesthetic, fighting colours along with his units, where primarily white with an accent of sapphire blue, a nod to the sinister glow emitted from his lens which in itself was a homage to his piercing blue eyes from his former self.
  <br><br>
It is here that Mechs and Marines takes place, in a galaxy divided into factions with more emerging all the time, where there is fighting amongst allies and enemies alike, all vowing that their way is the right way. With the Providers, Surface Men, Refineers, and the Corporations, each making waves and subsequently moves to peace and war.
